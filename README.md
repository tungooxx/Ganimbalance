**Improving Fraud Detection System Accuracy with GANs**

In our project, we aim to enhance the accuracy of a binary classification model used for fraud detection. The performance of the current model is suboptimal due to an imbalance in the dataset, which is a common issue in fraud detection.

As a solution, we'll utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a powerful class of generative AI models, to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions. These synthetic transactions are designed to closely mimic the characteristics of actual fraudulent transactions in our dataset.

The primary goal of using GANs in this context is to balance our dataset by augmenting it with these synthetic transactions. By addressing the data imbalance issue, we anticipate an improvement in the overall accuracy of our fraud detection model.

This project showcases the potential of GANs in dealing with data imbalance issues, particularly in the realm of fraud detection. We encourage you to explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute to this exciting application of AI.
